# 🎬 MoodFlix – Mood-based Movie Recommender (CLI)

**MoodFlix** is a command-line movie recommender system that suggests films based on:

- your **mood**
- the **time** you have available
- the **platform** you want to watch on (synthetic Netflix/Prime/Disney+/HBO Max tags)
- an optional **desired genre** (e.g. Action, Comedy, Drama…)

Under the hood, it uses a **content-based** approach built on top of the official [IMDb non-commercial datasets](https://datasets.imdbws.com/), combined with TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

> ⚠️ **Important:** This project does **not** include any IMDb data.  
> You must download the IMDb TSV files yourself and generate a local `movies.csv` file for personal / non-commercial use only.

## 🧠 How it works

- Data source: `title.basics.tsv.gz` + `title.ratings.tsv.gz` from IMDb
- We keep only:
  - real **movies** (`titleType == "movie"`)
  - with runtime, year, genres
  - with **rating** and at least **5000 votes**
  - from **1970** onwards
- We build a `movies.csv` with:
  - `movie_id` (IMDb `tconst`)
  - `title`, `year`, `genres`, `runtime`
  - `rating`, `num_votes`
  - synthetic `platforms` (deterministic mapping from ID → Netflix/Prime/Disney+/HBO Max)
  - a short `description`

The recommender:

- builds a text representation: `genres + description`
- computes TF-IDF vectors + a normalized runtime feature
- filters films by:
  - platform
  - duration range
  - mood-related genres
  - optional **desired genre**
- builds a **user profile** from mood + desired genre + target runtime
- ranks candidates using **cosine similarity**
